# Diagnostics

AMD Enhanced diagnostics are designed to be useful without collecting personal
data. A diagnostics directory contains:

- `openjkdf2.log`: human-readable events.
- `openjkdf2.jsonl`: one JSON object per event for tooling.
- `run-state.json`: `unclean` from startup until an orderly shutdown changes it
  to `clean`.
- `OpenJKDF2-crash.RPT`: a DrMinGW native crash report when an unhandled Windows
  exception occurs. The handler writes here instead of beside the executable.

Every structured event has a schema version, UTC timestamp, severity,
subsystem, event, and fields object. Event text is JSON-escaped and occurrences
of the configured game-data root are replaced with `<data-dir>`. Callers must
use `diag_redact_path` before adding any path rooted outside that explicitly
configured data directory. Usernames, hostnames, full command lines, saves, and
device serial numbers must never be submitted as diagnostic event content.

Run-state replacement is written through a temporary file so an interrupted
write cannot leave a partially written marker.

When `--data-dir <path>` is present, it is a read-only base-asset root and is
not translated to the legacy mod-oriented `-path` option. User-owned files use
`--user-dir <path>`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenJKDF2 AMD Enhanced` by default, or a
`UserData` directory beside the executable when `--portable` is explicit.
Relative reads prefer writable overrides before base assets; writes outside
the configured writable root are rejected by the overlay resolver.

The release-validation harness can opt into `OPENJKDF2_VALIDATE_SAVE_LOAD=1`
for a same-process save/mutate/restore check or
`OPENJKDF2_VALIDATE_RESTORE_ONLY=1` for a fresh-process restore check. These
variables are intended only for the guarded test script; they use the normal
game save system, emit phase results without save contents or user paths, and
are inert during ordinary launches.

`OPENJKDF2_VALIDATE_DEATH_RELOAD=1` similarly enables the guarded death and
autosave-reload lifecycle probe. It records only phase outcomes and numeric
gameplay state needed to diagnose suppressed damage; it does not record save
contents, asset contents, or user paths.
