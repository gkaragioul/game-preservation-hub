# Compatibility matrix

Results apply only to the exact tested hardware and settings. Capability-based
renderer paths contain no GPU-name allowlist. “Unverified” means no suitable
physical or remote host was available; it is not a compatibility claim.

| GPU | Architecture | Driver / OS | Backend | Tested settings | Result / limitation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX | RDNA 3 | 32.0.31021.5001 / Windows 11 | Hardware OpenGL | 2560x1440 Borderless @ desktop 165 Hz; one-minute Ultra run; 1920x1080 and 3840x2160 Windowed; 1280x720 second monitor; capped 60/120 | Pass for recorded probes: 3,597 frames; all 14 GLSL stages and 7 programs compiled/linked; 18 complete framebuffers; zero shader, texture-upload, Application Error, corruption, driver-crash, or software-fallback signals. Full-campaign endurance remains unverified. |

Refresh/display-mode coverage on the tested host was 165 Hz desktop. 60, 120,
and 144 Hz physical refresh switching was unavailable and was not simulated.
Exclusive Fullscreen is safety-gated and was not tested.
